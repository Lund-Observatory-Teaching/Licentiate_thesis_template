# Licentiate thesis template
This is a Licentiate thesis template for science students at Lund University. This repo is made by students, for students with no official involvement from the university. 
It is not necessary to follow the exact structure used for this template. It is merely provided as a reasonable example. 

The main file main.tex mostly contains code to import the individual parts that are in the text folder. 
Each Tex file has a comment at the top explaining (approximately) what should be in that file, and some of the major structural parts filled out with lorem ipsum. 
Replace references.bib with your own bib file with references. The aa.bst file contains the style for A&A and should not be changed. There should also be an empty folder named fig.
