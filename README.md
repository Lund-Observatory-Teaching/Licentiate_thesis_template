# Licentiate thesis template
This is a Licentiate thesis template for science students at Lund University. This repo is made by students, for students with no official involvement from the university. 
It is not necessary to follow the exact structure used for this template. It is merely provided as a reasonable example. 
Each Tex file has a comment at the top explaining what (approximately) should be in that file and some of the major structural parts filled out with lorem ipsum.
